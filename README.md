# ResourceDot

ResourceDot is a project authored by Rachel Addleman, Ingrid Cronburg, Sungwon Ma and Mackenzie Turner. It was created as a final project for Grace Hopper Academy in Fall 2016.  This project was imagined as a resource-sharing social network aimed at developers. During our time at Grace Hopper we came across many resources we wanted to share with our classmates.  ResourceDot is a centralized repository for sharing development resources. Anyone can add resources and create guides to share with others on our site.

The source code for the web-crawler we made for this project is available at https://github.com/kenzable/custom-crawlers
